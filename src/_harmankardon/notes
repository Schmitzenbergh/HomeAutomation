Available Actions
I've gone through all actions available on the official App so this list should be complete. Nevertheless it's possible that there are some hidden actions not supplied by the App. If you know or find some new, just let me know or open a Pull request. I'd be very happy about it.

All the actions can be triggered using the Zone object, either using run() or the magic method. You can also run your own requests by using API::generateRequest(), API::sendRequest() and API::readResponse().
